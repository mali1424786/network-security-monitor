# Network Security Monitor

A Python-based network security monitoring tool that detects port scans and traffic anomalies in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time packet capture and analysis using Scapy
- Port scan detection with configurable thresholds
- Traffic baseline establishment and anomaly detection
- JSON logging of security events
- Alerts for unusual ports and traffic spikes

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Scapy for packet capture
- JSON for data storage

## Installation
```bash
pip3 install scapy
```

## Usage
```bash
sudo python3 network_monitor_phase3.py
```

## What I Learned
- Network packet analysis (TCP/UDP/ICMP protocols)
- Security threat detection algorithms
- Python programming and debugging
- Network security monitoring concepts
- Reading and interpreting network traffic logs

## Note
This project was built with AI assistance as a learning exercise to understand network security monitoring and threat detection.
