**GitHub:** https://github.com/mali1424786/network-security-monitor

## Projects I Built

### File Integrity Monitor
- Detects unauthorized file changes using SHA-256 hashing
- Can detect ransomware by identifying mass file modifications
- Similar to enterprise tools like Tripwire

### Network Security Monitor  
- Analyzes network traffic and detects port scans
- Uses Scapy for packet capture
- Taught me how IDS systems work

### Other Tools
- Password Analyzer
- Log Analyzer
- Vulnerability Scanner

## Interview Pitch

"I built a File Integrity Monitor that uses cryptographic hashing to detect file changes. It can catch ransomware by alerting on mass modifications. You can see all my security projects on my GitHub."

## Key Skills
