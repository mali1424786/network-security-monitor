**GitHub:** https://github.com/mali1424786/network-security-monitor

## Projects I Built

### File Integrity Monitor
- Detects unauthorized file changes using SHA-256 hashing
- Can detect ransomware by identifying mass file modifications
- Similar to enterprise tools like Tripwire

### Network Security Monitor  
- Analyzes network traffic and detects port scans
- Uses Scapy for packet capture
- Taught me how IDS systems work

### Other Tools
- Password Analyzer
- Log Analyzer
- Vulnerability Scanner

## Interview Pitch

"I built a File Integrity Monitor that uses cryptographic hashing to detect file changes. It can catch ransomware by alerting on mass modifications. You can see all my security projects on my GitHub."

## Key Skills
- Python programming
- Network security
- Cryptographic hashing
- Log analysis
- Threat detection

## 💼 Common Interview Questions & My Answers

### Q: "Tell me about a technical project you're proud of."

A: "I'm most proud of my File Integrity Monitor. I used SHA-256 hashing to create file fingerprints and set alert thresholds for mass changes. When I simulated encryption by modifying 50+ files, my tool detected it and generated a critical alert. It taught me how enterprise security tools work and gave me hands-on experience with cryptography and threat detection."

### Q: "How do you stay current with cybersecurity?"

A: "I build practical projects to learn concepts. When studying for Security+, I didn't just read about file integrity monitoring - I built a working FIM tool. My GitHub at mali1424786 shows my hands-on approach to learning."

### Q: "What's the difference between hashing and encryption?"

A: "Hashing is one-way - you can't reverse a SHA-256 hash back to the original data. Encryption is two-way - you can decrypt data if you have the key. In my FIM, I use hashing to verify files haven't changed, not hide their contents."

### Q: "Why cybersecurity?"

A: "I'm fascinated by the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders. Building my security tools taught me that effective defense requires understanding how attacks work. I want to be on the blue team, protecting systems and responding to incidents."

### Q: "What certifications are you working on?"

A: "I'm currently studying for CompTIA Security+. I'm taking a hands-on approach - as I learn concepts, I build tools to implement them. My File Integrity Monitor project covers Domain 4.0 Security Operations concepts."
